# Appendix B

## Examples showing development of trial performance and a qualitative description of their change in similarity.

To illustrate the similarity measurement for different musical dimensions, the following figures show a typical improvement of the sung recalls of one participant of a particular test item. Due to space limitations, only the transcriptions of two trials can be depicted here.

Participant *F.S.* (male, aged 29, plays bass in rock band) listened to an audio excerpt from the pop song "Cold, Cold Heart" by *Wet Wet Wet*, the vocal melody of which is depicted in Figure 9. Despite the fact that it contains a large jump of one and a half octaves, participants found this melody generally rather easy to reproduce from memory, probably due to its clear phrase structure. Figure 10 shows the recall of *F.S*. after the third listening. The rendition resembles most to the third (and last) phrase of the original melody. Figure 11 depicts the rendition on the sixth and last trial. A great improvement in accuracy is clearly visible, although he altered all B flats to B naturals. When reflected by similarity algorithms, this will generally show an increasing score in overall similarity  per trial, though perhaps differing by specific dimension, depending on the type of error made in a particular attempt.

# Appendix F1

## Average by-participant across trials

Another way of visualising differences in performance is at the level of participant, coloured and ordered by level of musical experience. This is useful since it invokes no false dichotimisations and preserves the actual unit of participant (however, note that participant-level effects are captured by our mixed effects models).


## Average by-participant development of number of recalled notes events across trials


```{r, fig.height=10, fig.width=10}

plot_descriptive_vs_predicted_participant(
                              model = lm.B1.2,

  theme(plot.subtitle=element_text(size=7))


```



## Average by-participant development of opti3 across trials

As shown in the figure, participants seem to have vastly different slopes. The bottom right, lighter blue, higher musical experience participants (e.g., *VP5*, *VP7*, *VP30*, *VP12*, *VP17*, *VP24*, *VP2*) seem to have steeper slopes than the lower musical experience participants in the top left, darker coloured (*VP14*, *VP28*, *VP21*), suggesting that higher musical experience is related to quicker learning. However, note that this pattern is not the same for everyone e.g., *VP22* has a steep slope, but scores low on musical experience 



```{r warning = FALSE, fig.width=10,fig.height=13}

vp_summary <- main %>% 
  dplyr::rename(`Musical Experience` = musical_experience) %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(p_id, attempt) %>%

## Average by-melody development of no. of note events across trials



```{r warning = FALSE}

    dplyr::group_by(unique_melody_name) %>%
    dplyr::summarise(
      no_recalled_notes = mean(no_recalled_notes, na.rm = TRUE),
      opti3 = mean(opti3, na.rm = TRUE),
      N = N,
      ) %>%
    ungroup() %>%

      opti3 = mean(opti3, na.rm = TRUE)
      ) %>%
    ungroup()


```


Melody `r by_mel[[1, "unique_melody_name"]]` appears to be the easiest melody to recall (mean *opti3* across all trials = `r by_mel[[1, "opti3"]]`), whereas `r by_mel[[nrow(by_mel), "unique_melody_name"]]` appears most difficult to recall (mean *opti3* across all trials = `r by_mel[[nrow(by_mel), "opti3"]]`). This shows that there can be substantial variation in the difficulty of each melody.

# Appendix G Linear vs. Non-Linear Models for number of recalled notes and opti3

We proceed by using the log attempt as numeric predictor, owing to the observed non-linearities in both *opti3* and *number of recalled notes* across attempt. A comparison of linear vs non-linear models is shown below.

## Appendix G1: Linear model of mean similarity scores (number of recalled notes) across repeated attempts


```{r, tab.cap = "A linear model of number of recalled notes regressed onto attempt with melody item, participant and the interaction between melody item and participant as random effects. Note that the linear model is not taken forward."}

appen_g1 <- lmerTest::lmer(no_recalled_notes ~ attempt + (1|unique_melody_name) + (1|p_id) + (1|p_id:unique_melody_name), 
               data = main2)

Figure 12 shows that the use of the log attempt as predictor is justified, capturing the systematic non-linear pattern generally well.

To assess whether the change across attempts depended on musical experience, we fitted a mixed effects model with trial count as the dependent variable, participant as random effect and the following fixed effects: linear terms for attempt and musical experience; an additional quadratic term for attempt; a linear interaction term for attempt and musical experience; and a quadratic interaction interaction term for musical experience. The model is presented below.
